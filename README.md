# one_click_business
A REST api framework that allows you focus on your business.

Reinventing wheel is too boring and meaningless. The majority of businesses are simply CRUD operations and a little data summarization. Now we have plenty of web frameworks, however they still requires plenty of works to have a auth system, permission system and the most importantly, the database. Also, I know that millions of people have briallant ideas in their mind, and some of them must be world changing. However, they might not know programming or building website for now, and their passion may fade when they are trying to enhance themselves with codeing skill.

Therefore, I want to build a framework that has auth, permission and database already online and users could put 100% of their work on their own idea, rather than figuring out how to make these infrastructure work.

## Projects based on
1. FastAPI:
  A simple but powerful RESTapi framework, also implemented OAuth2 and OAuth scope. (tbh this project is just a simple demo of FastAPI for now)
2. Mongodb:
  Powerful DB, easy to use, friendly for rapid changing, tested by time.

## Future works
+ One click deploy
+ Admin page and utils
+ WebApp skeleton code using React.js to interact with server
+ Maybe other platform? I'm interested in flutter and will look into it in the future.
